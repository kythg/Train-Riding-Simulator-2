DisplaceY

DisplaceY is a Displacement deformer which driven by a 2D Texture or Sequence of Images.
It create a true surface bump by changing the topology of the object, 
Its actually moves the vertices of the object around Depends on Texture and vertices normals.
The whiter the map is, the farther out it pushes the geometry, and the blacker of the map is, the farther in it pushes the geometry.
With DisplaceY, depressions and elevations become part of the geometry of the object, changing the topology, 
unlike Bump maps that only create the illusion of surface relief.
You can deform every geometry with your own painted Textures, or any texture.

Because DisplaceY create true surface relief(Bump), they:
* can cast or receive shadows.
* can be seen if you silhouette the object.

It can be used to simulate any surface relief(Bump), Waves, rocks, Talking face(sequence of images), Changing terrain topology at runtime, ...etc.
